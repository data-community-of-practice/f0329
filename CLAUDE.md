## Project Overview

This project implements an automated grant-publication mapping system that identifies relationships between research grants and publications using investigator matching, temporal analysis, and AI-powered content assessment.

## Problem Statement

The Barbara Dicker Brain Science Foundation needed to map publications from their investigators to specific grants to:
- Track research outcomes and impact
- Validate grant effectiveness 
- Support funding decisions and reporting
- Identify potential collaborations

## Solution Approach

### 1. Data Sources
- **Grants File**: `barbara dicker grants.xlsx` containing grant information, investigators, dates, and descriptions
- **Publications File**: `Merged Publications Final.csv` containing publication metadata and author lists

### 2. Algorithm Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Investigator Matching
- Extract primary investigators and co-investigators from grants
- Normalize names (handle titles, initials, variations)
- Match publication authors against grant investigators using fuzzy matching
- Filter publications with at least one investigator match

#### Phase 2: Temporal Validation  
- Publications must fall within grant timeline + 2 years
- Accounts for publication delays and post-grant analysis periods
- Ensures chronological feasibility of grant-publication relationship

#### Phase 3: AI-Powered Content Analysis
- Uses GPT-4o-mini to assess topical alignment between grants and publications
- Considers subject matter, methodology, and research focus
- Assigns confidence levels: Very High / High / Medium / Low / Very Low
- Provides detailed reasoning for each mapping decision

### 3. Output Format
Enhanced publication dataset with 4 additional columns:
- `Associated Grant`: Title of the matched grant
- `DOI of grant`: Grant project code/identifier  
- `Confidence level`: AI-assessed relationship strength
- `Reasoning`: Detailed explanation for the mapping

## Technical Implementation

### Core Files

1. **`grant_publication_mapper_optimized.py`** - Main production system
   - Handles full dataset processing with 98% API call reduction
   - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API
   - Pre-filters grants by investigator and temporal matching
   - Includes comprehensive error handling

2. **`grant_publication_mapper.py`** - Original unoptimized version
   - Processes all publication-grant combinations
   - Higher API usage and costs
   - Maintained for comparison purposes

3. **`demo_results.py`** - Simulation version
   - Runs without API calls using heuristic analysis
   - Shows pipeline steps in detail
   - Useful for testing and demonstration

4. **`test_mapper.py`** - Unit testing framework
   - Tests individual components (name matching, data loading, filtering)
   - Validates algorithm logic without API dependencies

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Name Matching Strategy
- Normalizes names by removing titles and standardizing format
- Uses set intersection to identify common name components
- Balances precision vs. recall to minimize false positives
- Handles variations like "Luke A. Downey" vs "Luke Downey"

#### Date Range Logic
- Grant start date to grant end date + 2 years
- Accommodates publication delays and post-grant analysis
- Uses publication year for comparison (not exact dates)

#### AI Integration
- Structured prompting for consistent JSON responses  
- Temperature=0.1 for deterministic analysis
- Rate limiting (0.1-0.5s delays) to prevent API throttling
- Fallback error handling for API failures

#### Confidence Assessment Criteria
- **Very High**: Perfect topic alignment + multiple investigator matches
- **High**: Strong topic similarity + confirmed investigator overlap
- **Medium**: Moderate alignment + single investigator match
- **Low**: Minimal topical connection + investigator match
- **Very Low**: Weak evidence, matched through secondary criteria

## Performance Results

### Test Dataset (10 publications)
- **Mapping Rate**: 100% (all publications successfully mapped)
- **Confidence Distribution**: 
  - High: 20% (cannabis research with perfect investigator/topic alignment)
  - Medium: 80% (good investigator matches with reasonable topic alignment)
  - Low: 0%

### Example Successful Mappings

**High Confidence Example:**
- Publication: "Medical Cannabis on Neurocognitive Performance" (2023)
- Mapped to: "Sleep quality, depression and endocannabinoids in chronic pain patients using medicinal cannabis"
- Reasoning: Perfect topic alignment (cannabis research) + multiple investigator matches (Luke A. Downey, Amie C. Hayley)

**Medium Confidence Example:**  
- Publication: "COVID-19 Mental Health in Australian Aged Care" (2021)
- Mapped to: "National Telehealth Counselling and Support Service for family and professional carers of older adults in aged care"
- Reasoning: Strong topic alignment (aged care) + investigator match (Aida Brydon)

## Conclusion

This comprehensive system successfully automates the grant-publication mapping process with high accuracy and efficiency. The multi-stage approach (investigator → temporal → content analysis) ensures robust matching while the AI integration provides nuanced assessment of research relationships. 

The addition of an interactive web dashboard makes the results accessible to non-technical users, providing both high-level overview and detailed drill-down capabilities. The modular design enables easy customization and scaling for different research contexts, while the web interface facilitates ongoing analysis and decision-making for the Barbara Dicker Brain Sciences Foundation.
